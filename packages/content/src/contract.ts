const PURPOSE =
  "Capture, search, link, and publish: a plain-file document vault that is the source of truth, with full-text search, a wikilink graph, and immutable versioned artifacts served on demand.";

/** Prose, on purpose: which verb to reach for, and what a caller gets wrong.
 * Rendered verbatim by --agent-help, so it is written to be read by an agent
 * that has nothing else. */
const GUIDANCE = `A vault of plain markdown files is the source of truth. The SQLite index is
derived and reconciles itself on every read, so you may edit vault files
directly with your normal tools — get the path, edit it, and the next command
already sees the change.

Reading (safe anytime)
  agentwiki search "bluetooth hfp" --json    Ranked FTS hits with snippets.
  agentwiki list --tag decision --json       Newest first; --limit to bound.
  agentwiki get bluetooth-q30-hfp-trap --json
                                             Body plus frontmatter; add
                                             --meta-only to skip the body.
  agentwiki path bluetooth-q30 --json        Absolute path — edit that file
                                             directly, do not round-trip text
                                             through get and add.
  agentwiki resolve "the bluetooth trap" --json
                                             Ranked candidates when a spoken
                                             phrase might mean several docs.
  agentwiki backlinks bluetooth-q30 --json   Who points here (wikilink|mention).
  agentwiki links <ref> · graph · tags · doctor

  A <ref> resolves in tiers: exact slug, exact title, case- and article-
  insensitive match, unambiguous fuzzy contains, then the spoken words present
  in order ("the bluetooth trap" finds bluetooth-q30-hfp-trap). Two matches in
  a tier is an ambiguous_ref error naming the candidates — re-ask with a slug.

Editing (the path is the point)
  Nothing here rewrites a body for you. Take the path, edit the file with your
  own tools, and the next command indexes and commits what you changed.

Writing (files change on disk)
  agentwiki new "Bluetooth Q30 HFP trap" --tags evidence,audio
                                             Fails with document_exists if the
                                             slug is taken.
  agentwiki add --content "$body" --title "Q30 probe run" --tags evidence
                                             Capture never fails on a name
                                             clash; the slug slides to -2.
                                             A file argument or a pipe on stdin
                                             works too, but --content is the
                                             channel an out-of-process caller
                                             always has.
  agentwiki rm <ref> --reason "superseded by the duplex device"
                                             Stamps deleted: in frontmatter.
                                             The file never moves, links stay
                                             stable, readers exclude it.
  agentwiki restore <ref>                    Unstamps it.

Artifacts (immutable, content-addressed)
  agentwiki publish ./dist --name q30-probe --kind bundle --tag audio
                                             Version = content hash. Same bytes
                                             republished = same version. Writes
                                             a stub document under artifacts/
                                             so the artifact is in the graph.
  agentwiki artifacts list|versions <name>|show <name>
  agentwiki artifacts rm <name> --reason "wrong build"
                                             Tombstone only; the stub document
                                             tombstones with the last version.
  agentwiki gc                               The only command that frees bytes.

Serving (a resident launch agent)
  agentwiki serve --port 7777                Static bytes, localhost, no
                                             server-side execution. Immutable
                                             /a/<name>/v/<hash>/ URLs are safe
                                             to cite; /a/<name>/ tracks latest;
                                             /d/<slug> renders a document.
                                             Artifacts answer on their own
                                             origin (--artifact-port, default
                                             7778) so their scripts reach
                                             neither the vault nor the network;
                                             /a/… on the document port
                                             redirects there.
  agentwiki open <name>                      Errors with a recovery if serve
                                             is not already running.

History (automatic — do not commit the vault yourself)
  The vault is a git repository, and every command commits whatever it finds
  changed on its way out, then pushes best-effort when a remote exists. That
  includes files you edited directly: the command after your edit records it.
  A read-only command therefore still records an edit you already made — it
  writes nothing of its own. The derived index is gitignored and never enters
  history.

  agentwiki commit --message "..."           Record now rather than on the next
                                             command, with your own subject.
                                             The one gap it fills: serve never
                                             returns, so it never commits.
  agentwiki doctor                           Reports branch, remote, and how
                                             many commits are unpushed.`;
