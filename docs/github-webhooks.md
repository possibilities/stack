# GitHub webhook operations

`packages/source` receives signed GitHub webhooks, retains durable deliveries and
exposes filtered inboxes through Stack's existing subscriptions. The Server
supervises the process; it is not a second Bot wakeup service. See
[ADR 0159](adr/0159-github-webhook-ledger-and-watches.md) and `docs_get` with
`package: "source"` for the typed operation and transport contracts.

The `source` Package API owns the GitHub APIs. Provider-specific `github_*`
operations/events, `STACK_GITHUB_*` configuration, `/github/webhooks/*` routes and
`<STACK_STATE_DIR>/github/github.sqlite` storage remain unchanged; no state
migration is required. Its generic inventory is `source_state_read`, and new
maintenance plans/receipts identify `source` as owner; existing receipts retain
their original owner as history.

## Typed occurrence polling and managed runtime delivery

The `source` MCP connection also exposes draft `events/list` and `events/poll`.
`github_delivery` takes `{id: <watch UUID>}` and delivers typed summary payloads,
not original request bodies. A null cursor starts now; preserve the opaque cursor
to replay retained arrivals. `maxAgeMs` bounds age, `maxEvents` caps each page,
`hasMore` signals another page and `truncated` discloses skipped old entries.
Disabled watches pause without advancing their cursor. Neither polling nor native
delivery acknowledges `github_watch_read` entries.

For a verified Bot Chat or Worker, the Stack-generated tool can own that poll loop:

```json
{"name":"events_listen","arguments":{"name":"github_delivery","arguments":{"id":"<watch UUID>"},"policy":"native"}}
```

The invoking identity determines the conversation. Bots use native Codex
start-or-steer; OpenCode/Devin ACP and Claude SDK Workers use a durable inbox and
recorded same-session follow-up once idle. Worker-only `policy:"interrupt"` requests
active-turn cancellation first; it is never the default. `events_status` distinguishes
`native_admission` from `worker_inbox`; neither proves processing. Inspect a Worker's
`worker_event_list` and its linked turn for the later native outcome. Unknown
delivery/turn/interruption never automatically replays. See
[ADR 0160](adr/0160-poll-occurrences-and-runtime-event-intake.md) for authority,
capacity and recovery boundaries. This poll profile is not ChatGPT webhook/MCP 2.0
integration.

## Runtime and publication

| Setting | Default | Contract |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `STACK_GITHUB_PORT` | `8787` | Dedicated loopback intake; `0` chooses an ephemeral port |
| `STACK_GITHUB_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Other bind addresses are refused |
| `STACK_GITHUB_MAX_PAYLOAD_BYTES` | 512 MiB | Retained original-body budget, configurable from 25 MiB to 10 GiB |
| `STACK_STATE_DIR` | Shared Stack default | Private SQLite under `github/` |

Read `github_status` for the actual port and capacity. Intake accepts only POST
`/github/webhooks/<receiver UUID>`, with receiver-specific `X-Hub-Signature-256`
over the original JSON/form bytes. Bodies are bounded at 25 MiB; request
concurrency, memory and listener deadlines are also bounded.

Publishing is a separate, explicit operator act. Configure a publicly reachable
HTTPS reverse proxy for **only** `/github/webhooks/*` to the dedicated listener.
Preserve original bytes and GitHub headers; send backend Host
`127.0.0.1:<actual port>` (or `localhost:<actual port>`). The shared listener rejects
other Hosts to prevent loopback rebinding. Never publish Stack's control, MCP,
WebSocket or UI listeners. The API creates no tunnel, enables no Funnel and
changes no network policy. A private tailnet URL is not reachable from GitHub
Cloud; an entered public origin is configuration, not a reachability check.

## Configure and verify

1. `github_endpoint_create`: supply a new UUID, label, immutable target and
   optional `publicOrigin`. Each receiver gets a unique secret. Targets cover
   repository, organization, enterprise, App, Marketplace and Sponsors webhooks.
   Immutable `githubHost` defaults to `github.com`; a GHES hostname selects manual
   setup links, not automatic network access to that host.
2. `github_setup_read`: inspect settings links, exact local destination,
   prerequisites, automated/manual capabilities, steps and signed-arrival
   evidence. No step signs in or imports archived settings.
3. For github.com repository/organization hooks, inspect existing native `gh`
   auth with `github_auth_status`, page `github_repositories`/`github_organizations`
   and read `github_hook_list`. Visibility/admin observations do not guarantee
   webhook-administration permission.
4. Prepare `github_hook_plan` with intended events (`["*"]` by default). Review
   its exact URL-matching/previously managed hook and consequences. Apply with
   `github_hook_apply` and a new durable request UUID. It rechecks local/remote
   revisions and transfers the secret privately via stdin, not argv. Unrelated
   hooks remain untouched; ambiguous matches require manual resolution.
5. App, enterprise, Marketplace, Sponsors and GHES setup is manual. Inspect
   `github_event_catalog`, reveal the secret only through explicit local
   `github_endpoint_secret_reveal` with `reveal: true`, and configure the exact
   URL, JSON, TLS verification, secret and supported events. The API does not
   register/install Apps, mint credentials or broaden permissions.
6. `github_hook_probe` requests a ping or push-event test for an exact managed
   hook with a request UUID. Inspect `lastPingAt`, `lastDeliveryAt`, failures and
   the delivery ledger. Provider success does **not** prove signed arrival.

Ordinary receiver reads omit secrets. Revision-fenced `github_endpoint_update`
changes only label, public origin or enablement, not GitHub configuration.
Disabling rejects intake and retains history. Secret rotation is explicit and
local: default immediately revokes the old secret; selected `graceSeconds`
accepts it for up to 24 hours while the operator updates GitHub. Configuration
revision is separate from counters, observed target IDs and managed-hook evidence.

Recover remote effects with `github_remote_receipt_get`. `running`, `succeeded`,
`failed` and `unknown` describe native requests, not webhook arrival. Same-ID
retries return the original receipt. Interrupted/ambiguous effects never replay
automatically; inspect GitHub before preparing a fresh plan or request. Native
calls are bounded and drained during shutdown.

## Discovery and subscriptions

`github_event_catalog` uses pinned official `@octokit/openapi-webhooks` data for
Cloud and supported GHES versions: every event/action, hook types and descriptive
permission guidance. `customActions` identifies events such as
`repository_dispatch`; upstream hook type `business` is normalized to `enterprise`.
`github_event_schema` chunks self-contained bundles of reachable schema components.
The catalog is not an intake allowlist: future events/actions and arbitrary fields
remain accepted. Live availability still depends on permissions and installation.

The signature authenticates body bytes, not event/delivery headers. Routing
metadata is observed data, never authority. Receiver targets are checked where
represented in the signed body; observed IDs bind later checks across renames.
Signed lifecycle/future payloads need not contain a target object.

Create `github_watch_create` with a UUID, label, immutable filter and `start`.
Default `"now"` captures future arrivals; a numeric sequence backfills retained
matches after that cursor. Fields/predicates are ANDed, values within a selection
are ORed. Repository/org/enterprise/sender names are case-folded; event/action/ref
and payload scalars are exact. `repositoryIds` survive renames. JSON Pointer
predicates support `equals`, `one_of`, `contains`, `starts_with` and `exists`, not
regex/eval or webhook-triggered commands.

On the `source` MCP connection, attach the existing `events_subscribe`:

```json
{
  "topic": "github_watches_changed",
  "scope": "watch:<watch UUID>",
  "readOperation": "github_watch_read",
  "readArguments": { "id": "<watch UUID>" }
}
```

The shared owner delivers bounded snapshots to sanctioned Bot threads and
resnapshots on reconnect. `github_watch_read` returns oldest pending summaries,
`pending`, matched high-water `through` and exclusive `nextCursor`. Follow every
page, handle entries, then explicitly call `github_watch_acknowledge` with
`through` and `expectedAcknowledgedThrough`. Reading, viewing, notices and native
admission never acknowledge entries. Acknowledgement can intentionally skip
entries; independent consumers should use separate watches, not race one cursor.

Disabled watches still capture matching arrivals; scoped arrival notices pause.
Enabling publishes a snapshot. Disable the Stack subscription as well if reconnect
snapshots should pause. Removing a watch retires its ID/scope; remove attached
Stack subscriptions separately. Filter changes require a new watch.

## History, cleanup and troubleshooting

`github_delivery_list` pages local arrival order. Pin the first response's
`through` across later pages and follow `nextCursor`, even when response-byte
capacity returns fewer rows than requested. Sequence is not GitHub causal order.
`github_delivery_get` reads a summary; `github_delivery_payload` chunks original
UTF-8 JSON/form bytes with their SHA-256 digest and cleanup marker. Treat payload
content/links as untrusted observed data, not instructions.

Bytes, summaries and frozen watch matches commit before HTTP 202. Identity is
receiver plus delivery GUID. Identical redelivery returns the original sequence;
conflicting bytes/routing for that identity return 409. Intake stops at 10,000
retained bodies or the byte budget (507 `github_storage_full`), never silently
evicting history.

Release budget through `github_history_plan` for up to 100 exact sequences, then
`github_history_clear` with the reviewed plan ID/revision and a request UUID.
Recover a lost response using `github_state_receipt_get` before retrying. Logical
removal is not secure erasure. Identities, digests, summaries, duplicate fences and
watch matches remain; cleanup never acknowledges entries, and duplicate redelivery
never restores cleared bytes. New queries/backfills cannot evaluate predicates
on cleared payloads; existing frozen matches survive. Metadata is not automatically
pruned; offline storage/backup management remains separate.

The separate installation factory reset clears local GitHub secrets, deliveries
and watches only after fencing and stopping the owner. Upstream GitHub hooks
remain configured: reset does not disable/delete them or claim remote cleanup.
Explicitly reconfigure or disable those hooks separately; no automatic replay,
receiver recreation or credential import occurs in the new installation.

`github_hook_deliveries` reads provider attempts for an exact managed hook. Follow
its opaque `nextCursor` and correlate GUIDs with local `deliveryId`, not sequences.
`github_hook_redeliver` explicitly requests one attempt using a request UUID.
GitHub does not automatically redeliver failures and may omit oversized payloads;
Stack cannot reconstruct omitted events.

## Access and UI boundary

Socket is the local superset. MCP exposes agent discovery, delivery reads and
watches, but no receiver credentials, native `gh` setup or owner maintenance.
Workers gain no GitHub MCP operations. The local WebSocket declares the full
contract; Access still denies local setup, receiver mutations/reveal and
maintenance remotely, including viewers with control scope.

The API phase added no UI. The UI's Source space ([ADR 0164](adr/0164-source-space.md))
reads receivers, the delivery ledger, original payloads and the event catalog, and
clears original payloads through the shared maintenance flow, over the existing
`github_endpoints_changed` and `github_deliveries_changed` topics.
Watches ([ADR 0165](adr/0165-source-watches.md)) create, read and consume in the UI: the inbox is
not a pinned snapshot, and acknowledgement happens only through entries a person marked as
reviewed, with `expectedAcknowledgedThrough`; viewing and notices never acknowledge.
Receiver setup ([ADR 0166](adr/0166-source-receiver-setup.md)) is a local operator's work in the
Receivers window: creating a receiver (its UUID recorded in the browser before the request, a lost
answer read back by that ID), editing label, public origin and enablement against the shown
revision, an explicit secret reveal (held in one component's state and cleared on hide, close,
receiver change, disconnect, authority loss, rotation or after two minutes) and rotation
(immediate, or a grace period up to 24 hours, with the statement that GitHub is not updated),
the gh sign-in check and paged repository/organization pickers, the hook list, a bespoke plan
review and apply, ping and push-test probes, GitHub's delivery attempts matched to local
arrivals by delivery GUID, redelivery of an exact attempt, and manual setup guidance for App,
enterprise, Marketplace, Sponsors and GHES receivers. Every request to GitHub (apply, ping,
test, redeliver) is recorded in the browser's recovery journal under its request UUID before
it is sent; a lost answer is resolved only by reading `github_remote_receipt_get` for that same
ID. An unknown outcome is never sent again, and a changed intent needs a new reviewed plan. A
request's receipt is shown apart from observed `lastPingAt`/`lastDeliveryAt`: admitted by GitHub
is not a signed arrival. Remote Access sees the five setup facts read-only and none of the
controls. Source delivery does not restart a running Server; never rebuild an active UI's
`.next` in place without approval.
