/**
 * Stack Brain's internal operator contract. The Package API derives its
 * input schemas from these command arguments; shared transports own serving.
 *
 * This module is the single authorship of what this CLI is and what it
 * accepts. `guide --json` emits it verbatim; `--help`, `--agent-help`, and
 * `--agent-teaser` are rendered from it (see help.ts); the dispatcher takes
 * its command table from it (see dispatch.ts). Nothing here may be restated
 * in prose elsewhere in this repository — a second copy is exactly the drift
 * this contract exists to end.
 *
 * The normative schema lives at
 * `~/code/agentstart/config/agent-contract/schema.json` and is executed by
 * `~/code/agentstart/scripts/validate-agent-contract.ts`;
 * `test/agent-contract.test.ts` is this repository's own conformance gate.

rematerialization anyway. Treat queued, duplicate, and already_indexed as

immediately.`;

    audience: "agent",
  },
  guidance: `Stack Brain is the sole durable ingestion authority and the reader/writer for
this machine's local research index. Reach for it before any web search or
paid research call: the answer is often already indexed here.

Reading is safe at any time. Prefer \`context "query" --json\` for one bounded
search-and-evidence call; use \`search "query" --json\` when you want to choose
among ranked hits, then fetch the chosen evidence with
\`get --chunk-id ID --json\` (or --document-id / --source-uri). When discovery
is poor, inspect stats, tags, and sources and retry alternate terms before
concluding the index has nothing. Cite document_id, chunk_id when present,
title, source_uri, and relation provenance when it matters.

Writing goes through one door. \`submit\` is the durable admission boundary for
every text, file, directory, or URL intent, and writes no document directly;
\`ingest\` is an older spelling of it. Admission is durable and
offline, so never expect a submitted URL to be searchable immediately —
\`worker\` leases the job later and delegates all URL extraction and network
policy to Agentscrape. Stack Brain owns durable admission, the ingestion
ledger, Artifact snapshots, and index writes; Agentscrape owns URL fetching,
browser and session behavior, and extraction.

The ledger is content-safe by default. \`jobs list\`, \`jobs run\`, and
\`jobs stats\` never echo durable intent, raw URLs, Artifact bodies, or query
values. An ordinary \`jobs show\` adds bounded, sanitized failure summaries
with URLs redacted so a stranded job can be diagnosed without database access,
but does not reveal the submitted content. \`jobs show
--reveal-content\` reads Artifact bodies and appends a sensitive-inspection
audit record — pass it only when the body is genuinely required. Retry,
cancel, and exclude are explicit operator acts that append transitions and
preserve every attempt.

The Package API uses <STACK_STATE_DIR>/brain/research.db, defaulting to
~/.local/state/stack/brain/research.db. The internal operator dispatcher
also accepts an explicit --db path. Read commands open SQLite with a
structurally read-only connection and never initialize or migrate it.

The Package API publishes its operation schemas through Stack discovery.
For internal operator command help, run
\`node packages/brain/dist/src/cli.js help <command>\` from the workspace root.`,

performs no scheduling, rejects policy or cardinality mismatches before
claim, and never falls back to ordinary queue claims. Offline Runs cannot

narrows that one source to "only if actually due"; it is not an alternative

is why this is stated here rather than in constraints.

Sync performs no HTTP work, remote discovery, extraction, or document writes;
those remain worker and provider work. Schedule evaluation admits at most one
catch-up Run for each overdue source and advances its next due time from the
current evaluation, not once per missed wall-clock tick. Paused and disabled
sources admit no Runs.

--wait waits for the admitted discovery Run to finish through the resident
worker and returns a scheduler-facing execution receipt; it does not wait for
every discovered child URL extraction. A timeout exits 124 and a non-success
terminal outcome exits 1. For supervisors that treat every nonzero exit as an
execution failure, --wait-timeout-ok keeps timed_out:true in JSON but exits 0
